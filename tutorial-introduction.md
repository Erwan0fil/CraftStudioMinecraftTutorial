# Introduction

In this tutorial entitled "Crafting Minecraft in CraftStudio", you will learn step-by-step how to use the game making software **CraftStudio** through the building of a Minecraft-like game.


## CraftStudio

Have you ever wanted to create your own video game but don’t have a degree in comptuer science, art or design and know nothing about programming, modeling, level design ?  
Or maybe you do have degrees but don’t really know where to start to make a video game ?  
Maybe you just want to have fun while creating small fun games for your friend with your friends.

**[CraftStudio](http://craftstud.io)** is a cooperative game-making platform, but if it has been described as *game to make games*, it’s all but a toy !  
CraftStudio is an all-in-one game development software that let's you create any games while focusing on intuitivity, simplicity and fun !  

No other tool is required, you can create 100% of a game directly within CraftStudio !  
Assets you can create with CraftStudio includes models (with texture and animation), maps (with texture and tile sets), scenes, scripts, fonts, and more.  

And if you are of the social kind, fear not because CraftStudio is multiplayer and you can invite your friends to create a game with you in real time.

CraftStudio is also multi-platform. The editor works on Windows, Mac and Linux and allows you to create game for Windows, Max, Linux or the web (some of the games have even been successfully run on Android because the web player use the most modern web technologies, but mobile platforms are not officially supported).

CraftStudio offers a full scripting environment, powered by [Lua](http://www.lua.org) and even provide a visual scripting alternative.


### Daneel

**Daneel** is a scripting framework for CraftStudio that I started to develop in 2013.  
Its goals is to bring new functionalities to CraftStudio, extend and render more flexible to use the API as well as sweeten and shorten the code you write.  

Yet this tutorial is focused on CraftStudio itself, Daneel will be used and it's features will be explained as they are encountered.  
In the meantime, you can [learn more about Daneel's features](http://daneel.florentpoujol.fr) on its documentation.


## Minecraft

CraftStudio as very often been compared to Minecraft because you build things blocks by blocks in both.  
Also because the creator of CraftStudio developped a model exporter for Minecraft , CraftStudio beneficited of a lot of traction for the Minecraft community.
CraftStudio has also most notably been exibited at the Minecon 2012 as well as at *Des Cubes et Des Pioches*, another Minecraft convention in 2013.

The relation between CraftStudio and Minecraft are still strong and this tutotrial will make no exceptions.

As a game, Minecraft is interesting because it is very popular, so even if you didn't played to it, you probably have a good idea of what it is and how you play to it.
