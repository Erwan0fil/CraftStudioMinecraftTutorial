# Introduction to Models and Animations

Enought chit-chat, let's start creating !  
In this tutorial, you will create the model, texture and walk animation of Steve, your avatar.


## Create you first asset

By now you should have oppened your project and the interface should looks like this :

![Interface of a CS project](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51314747/CraftStudio/MinecraftTutorial/img/intro-models-animations/project-interface.png "Interface of a CS project")

On the top left you have the assets icons, then three buttons to create an asset, create a folder and duplicate an asset just abvode the asset list which is for now empty.

The model pane is the first one and is already selected, so lets create your first model by clicking on the `Create model` button (the left one).

<img class="float-left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51314747/CraftStudio/MinecraftTutorial/img/intro-models-animations/minecraft-steve.png" alt="Minecraft's Steve" Title="This is Steve" height="200px">

A new window opens an asks you to enter a name, just type "Steve". Click on the `Create` button (or press `Enter`) and the new model opens right away.

Before we begin lets think about Steve and what it is made of.

As you can see in the image to the left, Steve is a very simple model because it is composed of six blocks : one head, one trunk, two arms and two legs.  
The blocks themselves are very simple since the head is a cude, each arm and leg have the same size and are just elongated rectangular parallelepiped ("3D rectangles"), and the trunk is like an arm but twice as wide.  


## The Interface

![Interface of the model editor](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51314747/CraftStudio/MinecraftTutorial/img/intro-models-animations/model-interface.png "Interface of the model editor")

On the right, you have the list of blocks (models are only composed of blocks) and the two buttons to create and duplicate a block.  

In the middle you have the main window, it's in here that you will see the model and manipulate the blocks.  

Below you can find the chat and to the right, the list of people that have the model opened (with whom you can discuss via the chat). *Remember that one of the main feature of CraftStudio is that it's multiplayer, you can built any asset with several other people at the same time.*

On the left, you will find the `Build`, `Paint` and `Animate` panes which are the three tasks needed to build a model.


## Build : assemble the blocks

In CS, a model is only composed of blocks, which are always cuboid (rectangular parallelepiped). This limits how your model will look but cuboids are really simple to use, so that's great for newcomers (as well as anyone that is not a 3D modeler...).

Create your first block by clicking on the `Create block` button. As for the asset, give it a name, `Trunk` for instance as this block will be Steve's trunk.

Now a white rectangle as appeared in the main window, you can turn around it by having the mouse in the main window and moving it while pressing the mouse wheel (or left alt + left mouse buttons).  
The chat window also gives you instruction on how to move around the the model's window.


## Paint : the texture


## Animate : get the blocks moving
