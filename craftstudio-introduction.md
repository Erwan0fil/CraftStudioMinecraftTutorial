# Introduction to CraftStudio

In this chapter, you will learn more about the CraftStudio (from now on abreviated "CS" throughout the tutorial) ecosystem, how to install the editor and create a project.


## CraftStudio's community

This tutorial is obviously not the only resource where you can look for information and help.

[The official wiki](http://learn.craftstud.io) contains several tutorials as well the obligatory scripting reference, you might to bookmark it, as there are chances that you will consult it rather frequently.  
If you are not confident reading the wiki in english, you should know that it may have been translated to some extends by members of the community.

If you have particular questions that are not answered by the  wiki or this tutorial, [the forum](http://www.craftstudioforums.net/index.php?forum/) is the next best place to look for answers (before asling the question is no answer were to be found).

If you are interested in the development of CraftStudio, you may be interested to [follow Elisée (the creator of CraftStudio) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/craftstudiodev).

### Comunity Hub

The Community Hub is a CS project that always sits at the top of your projects list in the editor.

It contains hundred of assets created by many members of the community. Going through some of them can give you a overview of what you can create.
But keep in mind that most of the assets are actually just tryouts by inexperienced members and so the content of the Community Hud is not representative of the quality of what you can make with CraftStudio.

## Installing CraftStudio

### A little terminology first

Before we begin, it's important that we all know exactly what we are talking about :

The **Launcher** is where you log-in with your account and it automatically checks and dowload updates for any of the CraftStudio components.

The Client (that I call the **Editor**) is the software that you use to create all the assets and the games. It is launched by the launcher when it has finished updating but you can open it directly.

The **Server** is what hosts the projects that you create with the editor. By defaul a local server is launched at the same time as the client so you can just create projects locally (but the server can be remote).

The **Server Manager** is used to configure, start and stop the server.

The **Runtimes** are the *game engines*, they are what makes your games runs. There is one per platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Web).

The **Projects** are the games or movies that you edit via the editor. They are always hosted on a server.

The **Assets** are the game's components. It's what you create and assemble in a project. They are the Models, Animations, Maps, TileSets, Scenes, Scripts, Sounds, Fonts and Documents.


### Free vs Premium

CraftStudio comes with a free or a paid premium licence and you can upgrade from free to premium at any time very easily.

The free licence let's you create any number of projects and any kind of assets (except scripts).  
But you can't create script assets, you can't export or import assets from/to your projects and you can't export your game.  
It still gives you hours of fun and creation but you will quickly be pretty limited with the free licence if you want to pratice for real while following this tutorial.

The premium (or full) licence let's you do anything (including creating scripts, exporting/importing assets from/to your projects and especially exporting your game) and can be purchased for 20 euros (while in Beta) on CraftStudio's website.


### Dowload and install

First [create an account on CraftStudio's website](http://craftstud.io/login). This account is your identity in Craftstudio's community, so be wise with the name you choose.

[Download](http://craftstud.io/download) or [purchase](http://craftstud.io/purchase).

Proceed to the installation like with any other software. Note that the location you can choose only apply for the Launcher. The editor, server and runtimes are always installed in the same directory (`C:\Users\ [your user name]\AppData\Roaming\CraftStudio` on Windows8).  

The icon that may have been created will open the launcher. Once logged in, you only need to open the launcher to update CraftStudio.  
If you [follow Elisée (the creator of CraftStudio) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/craftstudiodev) or the #CraftStudio hastag, you will know when an update is available.  
So if you want you can open the editor directly by pointing at (`C:\Users\ [your user name]\AppData\Roaming\CraftStudio\CraftStudioClient\CraftStudioClient.exe` on Windows8).

### Creating a project

[ screenshot]
Click `Add or create project` at the bottom of the project list.

The window that open lets you connect to a server. Don't change anything as we want to connect to our own local server, which has been started along with the server manager when you openned the editor. Click `Connect`.

The window that open lets you see the projects hosted on the server.
